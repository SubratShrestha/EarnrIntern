## Fronend
This is the frontend part of the take home exercise for the Fullstack Developer Intern position at Earnr.

The frontend is written in ReactJS.

## UI
The UI components are from a react library called Rsuite.

## Documentation
* [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)
* [Rsuite](https://rsuitejs.com/guide/introduction/)

## Run
To run the frontend from this directory:

Install all dependencies with:
```
yarn install
```

and run the frontend with:
```
yarn start
```

Please note that the backend server needs to be running for the frontend to be able to interact with it.

Info about the backend server and how to run it is in the main README file, as well as the README in the backend directory.
